overview: |-
  Northern France is a region of transit largely due to its proximity to the U.K. Typically people-on-the-move (PoM) stay in informal living sites in Calais and Grande Synthe until the opportunity arises to cross the channel. So far this year, more than [28,592 people have crossed the English Channel to the U.K.](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-kent-62889043)

  Attempts to cross in a vehicle are often intercepted by the authorities and crossing the channel itself usually requires repeated attempts due to low-quality boats that can break apart after only a few minutes at sea, poor weather conditions, and/or intervention by authorities. The displaced community in northern France fluctuates in numbers – usually peaking during the summer months as weather conditions improve. The squalid living conditions represent real dangers to the displaced community in the region.

  You can stay up to date on events involving PoM in Northern France through [Human Rights Observers’ regular reports](https://humanrightsobservers.org/monthly-observations/).
governmentResponse: Displaced people in France face “[inhuman and degrading living
  conditions, as well as police abuse and harassment](https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2021/country-chapters/france).”
  The state sometimes provides emergency shelter during particularly cold weather,
  but almost all migrants are forced to live outside in makeshift camps. French authorities
  frequently dismantle and evict people from informal living sites, confiscate personal
  belongings, and partake in unlawful discriminatory actions.Police minimise livable
  areas and frequently seize property. [Human Rights Observers witnessed](https://humanrightsobservers.org/monthly-observations/)
  at least 156 evictions in February alone, and roughly 627 tents and tarps were destroyed
  across Calais and Grande-Synthe. These evictions [regularly subject people to violence

  description: It is difficult to gather accurate data on the number of displaced
    people in Northern France for several reasons. The population is largely on the
    move, with many travelling here to attempt to make the dangerous crossing to the
    UK. The French government continues to refuse support from the UN, so very few
    official statistics are collected. These numbers are small compared to Lebanon,
    for example, but since many groups here have lost their funding, operational security
    is under threat. There is a predominantly male population, a significant number
    of whom are unaccompanied teenagers. There is also a small population of women
    and children in Dunkirk.
