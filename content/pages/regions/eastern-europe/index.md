overview: The current situation in Eastern Europe has been heavily affected by the
  Russian invasion of Ukraine. It is estimated that over 11 [million people have crossed
  the border](https://data.unhcr.org/en/situations/ukraine) since the invasion began
  in February 2022. Most of the people who have left Ukraine are now temporarily residing
  in the bordering states. [The area includes parts of two major migration paths](http://www.infomigrants.net/en/post/36391/the-main-migration-routes-to-the-european-union)
  taken by people entering the European Union from the Middle East and Central Asia.
  The first route involves the Eastern border via Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus. The
  second route is the Balkan route, which has included Hungary and Romania in the
  past as well.
governmentResponse: "[Eastern Europe has been characterised by right-wing governments](https://www.oxfordhandbooks.com/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780190274559.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780190274559-e-28)
  making legislative changes which have worsened the situation for displaced people.
  Pushbacks, violence by authorities, and hostile attitudes by locals are common in
  the region. Given that the authorities often have violent responses towards people
  on the move, the need for medical support is usually great. Grassroots groups oftentimes
  have to provide the services which governments neglect. These groups usually also
  provide food, WASH, clothing, and other NFIs. Even simple services such as providing
  general information is often neglected by the governments in the region and has
  to be done by the grassroots groups that operate there."
