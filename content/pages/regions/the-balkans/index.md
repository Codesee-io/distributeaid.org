  - title: EU Increases Use of Technology to Monitor Migration
    content: The EU is applying new high-tech measures to hinder people from crossing
      into the EU, including [technology tracking, biometric data gathering, and drone
      surveillance](https://www.infomigrants.net/en/post/38478/digital-borders-eu-increases-use-of-technology-to-monitor-migration).
      This could lead to a decline in people migrating through these territories,
      choosing more dangerous routes, or taking greater risks on the existing Balkan
      route.

name: The Balkans
map: "/uploads/the-balkans.png"
overview: The Balkan region borders the EU and Schengen zone, which makes it a standard
  route for transitory migrants wishing to gain asylum within the EU. The Balkans
  act as a transitory region for people on the move, most from Afghanistan, Pakistan,
  Syria, Iraq and Iran. Many transition through in hopes of gaining entrance to Croatia
  or Hungary, from where they can travel to other EU states. However, [some 60,000
  people traveled along the Balkan route in 2021](https://www.infomigrants.net/en/post/38478/digital-borders-eu-increases-use-of-technology-to-monitor-migration).
  The Balkan Route is being used increasingly. [In August the number of arrivals was
  up by 35%](https://reliefweb.int/report/world/frontex-eu-external-borders-august-highest-number-arrivals-2016)
  compared to the same month last year. To note, people fleeing Ukraine and entering
  the EU through border crossing points are not part of this figure.
governmentResponse: 'Most states are often antagonistic towards people seeking refuge
  in Europe. Since 2017, there has been a problem of pushbacks along the Croatian
  and Hungarian borders: people attempting to cross a border are forcibly ‘pushed
  back’ into the country they entered from by authorities. The practice often constitutes
  human rights violations, including [assault, gender-based violence, and violence
  against children](https://refugee-rights.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/RRE_NoRightsInSight.pdf).
  Hungary is the only EU country to have formally legalised pushbacks nationally,
  although they are commonplace in many EU countries. There are reports of horrific
  violence at the borders on the Balkan route. [According to a report published by
  Save The Children](https://www.savethechildren.net/news/children-migrating-europe-experience-horrific-rates-violence-abuse-and-trauma-report),
  this is also experienced by minors. The violence usually happens during pushbacks,
  of which the Danish Refugee Council recorded [4,046 pushbacks in the first eight
  months of 2022 on this route](https://drc.ngo/our-work/resources/pushbacks/prab/).'

  description: _The Balkan Route_ is the name given to the route taken by many persons
    on the move who head north from Turkey or Greece towards Western and Northern
    Europe. Most people on this route are male adults and unaccompanied or separated
    children. As the people accessing NGO services in this region are largely in transit,
    their needs vary compared to those actively seeking asylum. Balkan countries experience
    extremely cold winters and very warm summers, meaning access to appropriate clothing
    and shelter year round is essential.
