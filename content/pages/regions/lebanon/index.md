overview: Lebanon is a country struggling with a crumbling economy, corruption, and
  structural inequality. Currently, [over 70 percent of Lebanonâ€™s population live
  below the poverty line.](https://reliefweb.int/report/lebanon/lebanon-country-program-overview)
  Lebanon also hosts the highest number of refugees per capita in the world, [with
  the government estimating that the country hosts 1.5 million Syrians, including
  831,100 registered with UNHCR, along with 13,300 refugees of other nationalities.](https://reporting.unhcr.org/underfunded-report-2022)
  The largest population of refugees is in Bekaa, which hosts [39% of total registered
  refugees](https://data2.unhcr.org/en/situations/syria/location/71). The lowest population
  is in South Lebanon, with [90,832 registered refugees.](https://data2.unhcr.org/en/situations/syria/location/71)
  The war in Ukraine has caused disruptions to the global food supply chain. On top
  of this, the Beirut port explosion in 2020 destroyed the port's enormous grain silos,
  the only such silos in the country. The impact of this has been rationing of bread,
  which has caused [anti-refugee sentiments to grow and clashes between Lebanese and
  Syrians have been reported](https://euromedrights.org/migrants-and-refugees-in-lebanon/).

  Experiencing a massive decrease in international and national funding for refugees, the Lebanese government [has yet to propose a long-term and viable plan](https://apnews.com/article/business-middle-east-lebanon-beirut-hezbollah-6fba3e7874b69381d194a029f51bda49) to improve the situation for refugees and Lebanese citizens struggling to make ends meet. Government restrictions increasing the risk of deportation mean fewer people register as refugees, further isolating them from support systems. [**A 2019 government decision**](https://www.nrc.no/news/2022/february/lebanon-syrian-refugees-face-evictions-as-they-take-desperate-measures-to-survive-the-winter/) preventing settlements from becoming permanent shelters has led to the systematic destruction of homes.

  [1 million Syrian refugees live in temporary shelters across 2,000 communities](https://www.concernusa.org/story/largest-refugee-crises/). Economic insecurity in Lebanon has resulted in [9 out of 10 Syrian refugees falling into extreme poverty](https://ec.europa.eu/echo/news-stories/stories/syrian-refugees-lebanon-between-hammer-and-anvil_en). The lack of legal residency creates barriers to jobs and essential services such as education and healthcare, leaving refugees vulnerable to exploitation, eviction and deportation.
